    "We have learned about linear and logistic regression. These methods facilitate supervised learning and enable us to approach prediction problems with a numerical (e.g., price) or categorical (e.g., repayment behavior=good or bad) target variable. \n",

    "In this session, we focus on practices to assess the accuracy of predictive models based on linear- or logistic regression. You will find more demos and small programming tasks. As to the tasks, remember that you are not supposed to know how to solve them right away. Rather, you are supposed to find solutions by discussing with peers, searching the web, or involving GenAI. That said, also recall that we never use GenAI without carefully inspecting generated codes **and** reading carefully the explanations of codes that are typically produced alongside generated codes.

Below we reproduce codes from earlier sessions to import standard libraries, load the data sets, and perform some rudimentary data preprocessing where needed. Just execute those codes and we are ready to go.\n"

    "So, as discussed in class, the evaluation of prediction performance is all about comparing model-based forecasts to actual outcomes. There are **two key ingredients** to make this work. First, we must define what we mean by *performance*. For this, we need suitable accuracy or error measures. Second, we must organize our data suitably to simulate a real-world application of a model. Before diving into each of these stages, let's revisit how we obtain predictions in the first place. This is where the `predict()` function of `sklearn` comes in handy."

    "Beyond splitting a data set into training and test set (aka the holdout method), we also introduced cross-validation, the process of partitioning a data set into *k* equally sized folds and repeatedly training a model on the combined data of k-1 folds and evaluating it on the left-out fold *k* times, such that each fold was used exactly once as the holdout or, synonymously , the *validation* fold. Relatively speaking, cross-validation is more reliable but also more costly than the simpler holdout method. It's costly because you have to train *k* models in total, which may cost a lot of time (e.g., when working with large data sets and/or complex ML algorithms). For the very same reason, cross-validation is also more reliable. You do not evaluate using one randomly sampled test set but carry out the evaluation *k* times.\n",

    "The coding demo was quite comprehensive. It is clearly time to give you a chance to try out your own coding skills. Prior to that, let's quickly note at least a few key findings from our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the test error varies a lot more than does the training error. This is less surprising when you remember how cross-validation works. The test set of each iteration contains roughly $\\frac{1}{k}$ of the data while the training set is much bigger, containing all $\\frac{k-1}{k}$ remaining data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, in this case, the median of the training and test set error distributions is roughly identical. This finding may look counterintuitive because we motivated cross-validation by saying that the performance on the training set is not a reliable estimate. While this statement is true, the results we observe are still plausible because we used linear regression. It is a characteristic of linear regression that training and test error deviate less than in other learning algorithms, as we will see in future sessions. "

    "### Exercise 3: \n",
    "Now that you saw the arguably most flexible and complex way to perform cross validation, your task is to simplify the above code using one of the other two options. This way, you will become familiar with all options and can make an informed choice next time you have to cross-validate a model. \n",
    "\n",
    "We continue with focusing on the California Housing data and linear regression. Depending on your preferences, we propose **two flavors of the exercise**. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 3.a (easier)\n",
    "Your task is to implement a 10-fold cross-validation of a regression model using the function `cross_val_score()`. More specifically:\n",
    "- Examine the function's documentation and make sure you understand its key arguments.\n",
    "- Write code to call the function such that it cross-validates a linear regression model for the California Housing data set\n",
    "- Perform ten fold cross-validation\n",
    "- Print the average performance of your model\n",
    "\n",
    "Should the above tasks have proved too easy we have a little extra task for you: ask yourself what specific error measure your code has considered. It is not so clear, right? \n",
    "\n",
    "<hr/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 3.b (harder)\n",
    "This version is similar to the above but involves the function `cross_validate()`, multiple error measures, and a more sophisticated way to visualize the results. Specifically, \n",
    "- Examine the function's documentation and make sure you understand its key arguments\n",
    "- Write code to call the function such that it cross-validates a linear regression model for the California Housing data set\n",
    "- Perform ten fold cross-validation\n",
    "- Your evaluation should comprise different error measures, namely, the MAE, the MSE, and the MAPE.\n",
    "- Visualize the performance of the regression model for each error measure using a box-plot\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Hint**: take a look into the [sklearn documentation on the scoring parameter](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#multimetric-scoring) to learn about ways of specifying error measures in a cross-validation process."

    "## Measuring classification performance\n",
    "We cannot finish without discussing classification performance. The evaluation of a classifier differs from a regression model because our forecasting target is a categorical and often binary variable. We focus on the latter case and return to our HMEQ data set associated with predicting good and bad credit risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confusion matrix to assess discrete class predictions\n",
    "Let's start with the more intuitive case in which we assess the binary class predictions of the logistic regression model. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 4:\n",
    "We start with an easy task to get started: \n",
    "- Split the HMEQ data set into training (70%) and test set (30%) using the holdout method\n",
    "- Train a logistic regression model on the training set\n",
    "- Compute discrete class predictions using the test set\n",
    "- Store your predictions in a variable `class_pred`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find pretty much all the codes needed to solve this exercise in previous parts of the notebook."

    "### ROC analysis\n",
    "The confusion matrix suggests that our logistic regression is doing a very poor. It consistently predicts the class *Good risk*, meaning it would give every applicant credit. Put in statistical terms, the logistic regression acts like a **naive classifier** by always predicting the majority class in the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the confusion matrix depicts the performance of a classifier for one specific **cut-off**. By default, the `predict()` function of `sklearn` sets this cut-off to 0.5. It may be that our logistic regression is a bit more useful that we think. Specifically, it may be that the default cut-off was inappropriate and that we would see a better performance with a different cut-off. Entry **ROC-analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROC-analysis visualizes the performance of a classification model across **all possible cut-offs** and will give us a deeper understanding of whether the logistic regression is really naive or in fact able to distinguish good and bad payers to some extend. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 5:\n",
    "- Familiarize yourself with the function `RocCurveDisplay` which is available in the `sklearn.metrics` module.\n",
    "- Write code to obtain **probability predictions** for the test set of the HMEQ data set (you can reuse `log_reg` for this task)\n",
    "- Using the functionality of `RocCurveDisplay`, create an ROC curve.\n",
    "- Write a short interpretation of the result. How well does logistic regression performs in your opinion?"
